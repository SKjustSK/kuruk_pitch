Before accessing the website, api keys are needed for respective servieces ->

1. Google Maps API

Create a `.env` file in /frontend_infinite_loop/ directory and put the following contents:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_KEY="public_NzSRiEU4ALXmWmhYr27mbe2lgqE="
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_ENDPOINT="https://ik.imagekit.io/dp5r64coi/"
PRIVATE_KEY="private_7BBhM3oeH0sZLlIcsxALNcSb1kI="

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="AIzaSyAT4TBVLGRAvNUq8O177-JGiWuQadk3Pb0"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID="2e0ddee4c610d77b"
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLAB_PUBLIC_URL="https://e55b-34-125-17-227.ngrok-free.app"
```

Go into the /frontend_infinite_loop/ directiory, and perform

Our backend is built in Google Collab, there it won't be directly show caseble in github, however we assure you it works perfectly.
